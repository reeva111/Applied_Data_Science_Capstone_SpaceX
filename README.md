# Applied_Data_Science_Capstone_SpaceX
In this project, I've made a Machine Learning model that predicts booster recovery with nearly 94% accuracy. 

In today’s fast-paced and competitive space industry, SpaceX has completely changed the game with its reusable launchers and boosters, like the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy. The big win here? A massive cut in the cost per kilogram of payload, making space more accessible than ever before. Of course, it’s not all smooth sailing. Compared to traditional launch vehicles like the Soyuz or Ariane-5, reliability is still a bit of a challenge. For SpaceX, though, success isn’t just about getting the payload into orbit—it’s also about bringing the booster back safely, which keeps their costs low and their edge sharp.

Whether a Falcon 9 booster lands successfully depends on factors like:
 The orbit it’s headed to
 How heavy the payload is
Which version of the booster is being used
Where the launch happens
